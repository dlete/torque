        address_ip (str)
        os_username (str)
        os_password (str)
        peers_expected (list)

    Returns:
        list: each item in the list is a line of text. Each line of text begins
        with either of the keywords: PASS, FAIL, or WARNING. These first
        keywords are always in capital letters.

    Requires:
        Python 3.5.2
        junos-eznc 2.1.3

    To-do:
        Add error handling. We are not checking what to do if we can't connect
        to the Device.
